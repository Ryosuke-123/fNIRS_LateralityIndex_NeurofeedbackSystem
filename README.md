### For Researchers
Functionl Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is noninvasive neuroimaging technique that measure hemodynamic signals related to functional activation in the brain. It is used in reseach in various fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and developmental scinece. <br>
One of the promising application of fNIRS utilizing is neurofeedback (NF). NF is a technology that promotes self-adjustment of brain activity by analyzing the measured brain activity in real time and providing feedback to the participants. <br>
The asymmetry in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation has been noted as a potential feedback biomarkers (Li et al., 2019; Baik et al., 2019; Slutter et al., 2021). The NF system that provide feedback the asymmetry in PFC activaiton have already been developed (Aranyi et al., 2016). However, it is relied on expensive measurement device and video device, which may be an obstacle to practical application and dissemination. Therefore, we aimed to develop a low-cost and simple fNIRS-based NF system that provides feedback of the asymmetry in PFC activation. <br>
Our system is characterized by a 2-channel wearable device, a robust asymmetry calculation algorithm against noise, auditory feedback system that can be used in various situation. <br>
