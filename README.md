## Introduction
Functionl Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is noninvasive neuroimaging technique that measure hemodynamic signals related to functional activation in the brain. It is used in reseach in various fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and developmental scinece. <br>
<br>
One of the promising application of fNIRS utilizing is neurofeedback (NF). NF is a technology that promotes self-adjustment of brain activity by analyzing the measured brain activity in real time and providing feedback to the participants. <br>
<br>
The asymmetry in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation has been noted as a potential feedback biomarkers (Li et al., 2019; Baik et al., 2019; Slutter et al., 2021). The NF system that provide feedback the asymmetry in PFC activaiton have already been developed (Aranyi et al., 2016). However, it is relied on expensive measurement device and video device, which may be an obstacle to practical application and dissemination. Therefore, we aimed to develop a low-cost and simple fNIRS-based NF system that provides feedback of the asymmetry in PFC activation. <br>
<br>
Our system is characterized by a 2-channel wearable device, a robust asymmetry calculation algorithm against noise, auditory feedback system that can be used in various situation. <br>

## For who want to use this NF App
In order to conduct a placebo-controlled experiment for you, we developed two applications: an app that provides accurate neurofeedback (NF App) and an app that provides false neurofeedback (Placebo App). The APK files for each app can be downloaded from the links below. <br>
・NF App: [this releases page](). <br>
・Placebo App: [this releases page](). <br>

## For who want to re-analyze our NF training Data
In order to allow you to re-analyze the data obtained from our NF training experiment, we have shared the data in public repository (OpenNeuro). These data and our analysis scripts can be downloaded from the links below. <br>
・NF Training Data: [this releases page](). <br>
・Analysis Scripts: [this releases page](). <br>

## For who want to change our NF App
In order to change our NF app, you need to purchase "ExBrainSdkAndroidLibrary" provided by NeU Inc. The company's website can be accessed at the following link. <br>
